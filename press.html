            <h4>
              Sacramento Congressional Candidate David Mandel Criticizes Area
              Congressional Members, Biden Admin for Failure to ‘Confront
              Humanitarian Crisis in Gaza’
            </h4>

            <p>
              SACRAMENTO, CA – Congressional (CD7) candidate David Mandel late
              Friday criticized Sacramento area incumbent members of Congress
              for failing to “confront the humanitarian crisis in Gaza” and the
              Biden Administration actions a “mark of shame.”&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              Mandel, a human rights lawyer and former Sacramento Bee copy
              editor running to replace Rep. Doris Matsui, declared, “I continue
              to call for an immediate, permanent ceasefire in Gaza.”&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>Mandel’s full comments:&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              “The recent decision by the International Court of Justice (ICJ)
              on the genocide in Gaza, while a significant step in the right
              direction, fails at the crucial step of calling for an immediate
              cessation of military action against the Palestinian people.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              “The decision contains major judicial wins, including the
              establishment of jurisdiction over the case, the ordering of an
              immediate end to any genocidal acts by the military and genocidal
              rhetoric by government officials, and the recognition of the
              worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              “However, while an order to de-escalate and stop the killing may
              be inferred from the decision, the lack of an explicit call for a
              ceasefire leaves Palestinians in an uncertain and untenable
              position. The decision’s ambiguity on the cessation of military
              operations in Gaza allows Israel to continue its violence for at
              least the next month, when the first ‘progress report’ is
              due.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              “How many Palestinians will lose their lives in that time?
              Furthermore, it is apparent from the conduct of government
              officials that Israel does not plan to abide by the ICJ’s ruling,
              no matter how lenient.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              “Though the decision has significant shortcomings, where it does
              succeed is in providing a stark reminder of the Biden
              administration's failure to take a principled stand against the
              atrocities in Gaza, instead taking every possible opportunity to
              provide funds and weapons to further Israel’s campaign of
              destruction.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              “Despite mounting evidence and international condemnation, the
              Biden administration continued to provide material support to
              Israel’s actions in Gaza, which now, according to the ICJ, may
              legally constitute genocide and absolutely constitute a
              humanitarian crisis.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              “The ICJ’s decision on the case now serves as an uncomfortable
              spotlight on their stance, placing them on the wrong side of
              history. It is imperative that our elected representatives
              reassess their positions, aligning themselves with justice and
              human rights rather than with the lobbyists who line their pockets
              and fill their campaign coffers.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              "The ICJ's ruling serves as a mark of shame on the Biden
              administration, one that will follow Biden to November and
              beyond.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              “Congress, too, has failed to confront the humanitarian crisis in
              Gaza, and the bipartisan commitment to serving the interests of
              the pro-Israel lobby has impeded progress toward even the most
              basic recognition of the plight of the Palestinian people.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              “This was especially clear in the embarrassing letter signed by
              210 members of Congress (including Sacramento’s own Rep. Ami Bera
              and Rep. Doris Matsui), calling South Africa’s case against Israel
              ‘grossly unfounded,’ ‘meritless’ and ‘deeply hostile,’ expressing
              ‘disgust’ at the accusations altogether.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              “I call on the Biden administration and Congress to acknowledge
              the gravity of the ICJ's ruling and take immediate, meaningful
              action to urge Israel to comply with the findings. Biden must
              ensure that the United States does not use its veto to block the
              enforcement of the ruling when it comes before the Security
              Council, and put the full force of its political influence to work
              ensuring Israel complies with international law.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              "In the meantime, I continue to call for an immediate, permanent
              ceasefire in Gaza.”&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              Mandel said he’s running for public office “because our longtime
              incumbent, along with most of Congress, is out of step with voters
              in the district and around the country.”&nbsp; Mandel added, “Amid
              vicious attacks on basic democracy, widespread economic hardship
              and horrific wars around the globe making the climate crisis even
              worse, this is no time to stand in the middle of the road. “Not
              too bad” is not nearly good enough.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              “But in truth, ‘normal’ for decades has meant steady social
              polarization over politically manipulated ‘culture wars’; immense
              growth in wealth for the few while most fall behind and nearly
              half the country lives in or near poverty with millions un/or
              inadequately housed, while hedge funds rake in profits; a
              criminally inadequate corporate healthcare system; still rampant
              and too often violent racism, sexism, misogyny, homo- and
              transphobia; a racist criminal justice system; rampant political
              corruption; environmental and climate disaster.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am not a career politician, but for decades I’ve been an
              advocate for honesty, peace and social justice, as a partner and
              father, in my work as a journalist and an attorney for the
              disadvantaged and oppressed, and as a dedicated volunteer with
              numerous organizations carrying on the fight for a better world,”
              Mandel said.

            <h4>
              Sacramento Congressional Candidate David Mandel Criticizes
              Response of Reps Matsui and Bera as ‘Too Little, Too Late’ to Help
              Gaza Palestinians
            </h4>

            <p>
              SACRAMENTO, CA – Congressional (CD7) candidate David Mandel
              Tuesday strongly criticized a letter signed by Reps. Doris Matsui
              (CA-7) and Ami Bera (CA-6) concerning Palestinians from the Gaza
              Strip as “too little, too late” to help the Palestinians.
            </p>

            <p>
              “If Matsui and Bera are truly concerned about the well-being of
              Palestinians and their future on the land, they must push for a
              full and permanent cease-fire immediately and oppose any continued
              aid to Israel until Gaza is rebuilt and the occupation and
              apartheid are ended. For those of us who are serious about seeing
              hostages and prisoners freed and pursuing peace and safety for
              Palestinians and Israelis alike, this is the only way forward,”
              said Mandel.
            </p>

            <p>
              Mandel, a human rights activist, former daily newspaper editor and
              attorney providing free legal services for seniors, added while he
              agreed with the content of the congressional letter to Secretary
              of State Anthony Blinken urging him to reiterate the U.S.’s firm
              opposition to any forcible removal of Palestinians from the Gaza
              Strip, “it fails to challenge the Biden administration’s
              blank-check support of Israel’s attack on Gaza.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Mandel charged, “Matsui and Bera have both refused to call for a
              cease-fire, despite nonstop urging from their constituents and
              ample opportunity to oppose Israel’s unmitigated killing,
              starvation and internal displacement of Palestinians. Put simply,
              it is textbook hypocrisy to cosign the Biden administration’s
              support of Israel’s out-of-control military campaign, only to urge
              the administration to oppose the forced displacement of those same
              Palestinians to other countries.
            </p>

            <p>
              “To sign this letter now is too little, too late. I, like 80% of
              Democratic voters and two-thirds of all Americans, have been
              calling for an immediate cease-fire and de-escalation of violence
              in Gaza since October. Any other position is unconscionable and
              inhumane. Israel has openly rebuffed Biden’s half-hearted attempts
              to curtail its violence in Gaza, because so long as financial and
              military support keep flowing, such entreaties have no teeth.
            </p>

            <p>
              “There is no reason to believe that this letter will move the
              Biden administration to do more than issue empty threats while
              allowing Israel to dispose of the people of Gaza as it pleases,”
              Mandel added.
            </p>

            <p>
              Noting “Netanyahu has explicitly described plans for the expulsion
              of Palestinians across the southern border under the insulting
              euphemism of ‘voluntary migration’ – how can any migration be
              voluntary when most homes are destroyed and people are being
              pushed south under bombardment and gunfire,” Mandel said,
              “Israel’s goal of flattening Gaza and building on its ruins has
              long been clear, and yet, Matsui and Bera have unwaveringly voted
              to send money and weapons to aid the ethnic cleansing campaign.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Mandel added, “Israel had destroyed 70 percent of all homes in
              Gaza, with the full-throated financial and diplomatic support of
              the United States. 1.9 million Palestinians in Gaza – 80 percent
              of the population – have been internally displaced, concentrated
              in the southern part of the Strip against the Egyptian border,
              where promises of safety have been broken.
            </p>

            <p>
              “Beyond internal displacement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
              and his coalition partners have expressed in no uncertain terms
              Israel’s desire to ethnically cleanse the Gaza Strip, removing the
              people from the land, destroying hospitals, schools and historical
              landmarks and erasing them from history.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Mandel said he’s running for public office “because our longtime
              incumbent, along with most of Congress, is out of step with voters
              in the district and around the country.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Mandel added, “Amid vicious attacks on basic democracy, widespread
              economic hardship and horrific wars around the globe making the
              climate crisis even worse, this is no time to stand in the middle
              of the road. “Not too bad” is not nearly good enough. A different
              world – one based on the needs of people and the Earth, not
              corporate profits – is possible. We survived four years of an
              embarrassing, dangerous megalomaniac of a president, then many of
              us breathed a sigh of relief, thinking we could return to
              ‘normal.’
            </p>
            <p>
              “But in truth, ‘normal’ for decades has meant steady social
              polarization over politically manipulated ‘culture wars’; immense
              growth in wealth for the few while most fall behind and nearly
              half the country lives in or near poverty with millions un/or
              inadequately housed, while hedge funds rake in profits; a
              criminally inadequate corporate healthcare system; still rampant
              and too often violent racism, sexism, misogyny, homo- and
              transphobia; a racist criminal justice system; rampant political
              corruption; environmental and climate disaster.
            </p>

            <p>
              “I am not a career politician, but for decades I’ve been an
              advocate for honesty, peace and social justice, as a partner and
              father, in my work as a journalist and an attorney for the
              disadvantaged and oppressed, and as a dedicated volunteer with
              numerous organizations carrying on the fight for a better world,”
              Mandel said.

            <h4>
              Human and Civil Rights Lawyer David Mandel, Seeking to Unseat Rep.
              Doris Matsui, Marches on MLK Jr. Day, Remembers Decades of
              Protests, Multiple Arrests Seeking Justice and an End to Racism
            </h4>

            <p>
              SACRAMENTO, CA – Human and civil rights attorney David Mandel,
              opposing Rep. Doris Matsui in the California CD 7 primary in
              March, is joining MLK Jr. Day marchers Monday – as he has for
              decades – calling for “Justice in Action. For Peace, Human Rights
              and a Sustainable Tomorrow.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Mandel explains he joined the “struggle for racial justice and
              equality as a teen through the mentorship of his rabbi, who
              marched with Dr. King in the South and helped welcome him when he
              came north to confront racism in the Chicago area.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Mandel, who organized anti-war protests at his high school, has,
              more than 50 years later, joined the recent waves of Sacramento
              Black Lives Matter marches and other actions, as a participant and
              as a legal observer.
            </p>

            <p>
              Living in Israel from 1974 to 1985, Mandel said, “I observed the
              varieties of apartheid imposed against non-white Jews and
              especially against Palestinian Arabs and joined the movement
              against oppressive occupation. I was proudly arrested five times
              for acts of nonviolent civil disobedience,”
            </p>

            <p>
              The human rights attorney and former newspaper reporter and editor
              added, “The struggles for justice worldwide are interconnected.
              U.S. support for Israel’s genocidal acts against the people of
              Gaza violates not only international law but also essential human
              morality.”
            </p>

            <p>
              “The nearly $1 trillion a year in military spending harms our
              ability to prioritize housing and healthcare as fundamental human
              rights, to adequately invest in education, and to devote the
              substantial funding required to combat climate change and protect
              the planet,” Mandel added.
            </p>

            <p>
              Mandel said he’s running for public office “because our longtime
              incumbent, along with most of Congress, is out of step with voters

              activist/candidate said.

              Mandel, who worked in both Israel and the U.S. as a magazine and
              newspaper editor, including for 10 years at the Sacramento Bee,
              has written extensively for U.S. and European publications about
              Middle East politics.
            </p>

            <p>
              Mandel led the free legal services program for Sacramento and
              California seniors for 17 years, helping clients fight evictions,
              foreclosures, discrimination, denials of health care and public
              benefits and much more.
            </p>

            <p>
              Mandel has also worked on legal cases to defend faculty and
              students under fire for engaging in support for Palestinian rights
              on campus and an appellate case defending a business’s right to
              boycott; and he led the 2016 fight against a state anti-boycott
              bill, saving California from having to defend an unconstitutional
              statute.

              Born in Chicago and a Sacramentan since 1985, Mr. Mandel has been

              stopping climate change, ending racism, patriarchy and predatory
